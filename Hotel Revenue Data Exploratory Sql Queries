Firstly, I created a database and named it Hotel Database
Then I imported excel files into my database 

**Fetching Data from Tables**
select * from dbo.['2018$']
select * from dbo.['2019$']
select * from dbo.['2020$']

**Combine the data from the three tables**
select * from dbo.['2018$']
union
select * from dbo.['2019$']
union
select * from dbo.['2020$']

**Create cte to combine data for exploratory analysis* 
with hotels as(
select * from dbo.['2018$']
union
select * from dbo.['2019$']
union
select * from dbo.['2020$'])

select * from hotels

*Is the hotel revenue growing yearly?*
In the dataset we donâ€™t have revenue, but we do have adr (Average Daily Rate), stays_in_week_nights, and stays_in _weekend_nights. So, we will create a new column revenue by using the data of these three columns as follows:
select 
  (stays_in_week_nights + stays_in_weekend_nights) * adr
  as revenue from hotels
select 
arrival_date_year
sum((stays_in_week_nights + stays_in_weekend_nights) * adr)
as revenue from hotels group by arrival_date_year

**In the following table, we can see that the revenue increased from 2018 to 2019 but then decreased again in 2020. **

**We can also determine the revenue trend by hotel type by grouping the data by hotel and then seeing which hotels have generated the most revenue.**
select 
arrival_date_year, hotel,
sum((stays_in_week_nights + stays_in_weekend_nights) * adr)
as revenue from hotels group by arrival_date_year, hotel

**Should we increase our parking lot size**
select
arrival_date_year, hotel,
sum((stays_in_week_nights + stays_in_weekend _nights) * adr) as renenue,
concat (round((sum(required_car_parking_spaces)/sum(stays_in_week_nights +
stays_in_weekend_nights)) * 100, 2), '%') as parking_percentage
from hotels group by arrival_date_year, hotel

We can observe that we have enough space for parking. So, there is no need to increase our parking lot size.

Before moving to PowerBi, we will join some correlating tables together.  
with hotels as(
select * from dbo.['2018$']
union
select * from dbo.['2019$']
union
select * from dbo.['2020$'])

select * from hotels
left join dbo.market_segment$
on hotels.market_segment = market_segment$.market_segment
left join dbo.meal_cost$
on meal_cost$.meal = hotels.meal
